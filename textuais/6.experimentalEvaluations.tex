%######################################################

We carried out this preliminary evaluation from the replication of the experimental protocol performed in a previous study~\cite{Lopes:2019}, which aimed to obtain evidence of the comparison from two approaches for modeling relational databases, one graphical and the other textual.
% This preliminary evaluation was carried out from the replication of the experimental protocol performed in a previous study~\cite{Lopes:2019} and aims to obtain evidence from the comparison of two approaches for modeling relational databases, one graphical and the other textual.

We specified the following treatments:
\begin{enumerate} [label=\roman*.]
    \item Control treatment: the brModelo tool (graphical approach) and;
    \item Experimental treatment: the ERtext tool (textual approach).
\end{enumerate}
This replication goal is to evaluate the feasibility of using a textual approach to support the teaching-learning process of conceptual modeling relational databases.
% The purpose of this replication is to evaluate the feasibility of using a textual approach to support the teaching-learning process of conceptual modeling relational databases.

\textbf{Context:}
% The context of the experiment is characterized according to four dimensions:
We characterized the context of the experiment according to four dimensions:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item Process: Process: it used an \textit{in-vitro} approach since we performed the tasks under controlled conditions;
    % Process: an \textit{in-vitro} approach was used, since the tasks were performed under controlled conditions.
    %In software engineering, most \textit{in-vitro} experiments are executed in universities or among selected groups of a software development organization~\cite{Travassos:2003}.
    \item Subjects: undergrad students in Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering (SE) programs;
    \item. Reality: the experiment addressed a real problem, \textit{i.e.}, the difference in the effort spent by subjects in the conceptual modeling of relational databases; 
    %the artifacts quality produced and the subjects Perceived Usefulness (PU) using both approaches.
    \item Generality: we inserted this evaluation in a specific context involving database modeling students.
    However, we can replicate the general ideas of this experiment in another set of subjects, approaches, or DSLs that support database designing.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Research Questions (RQs):}
Regards the discussion of controlled experiment results, we decided to formulate four RQs related to the activities performed in the protocol execution.
% For the controlled experiment results discussion, we decided to formulate four RQs related to the activities performed in the execution of the protocol.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{RQ1.} Which approach requires the most effort spent on average during the modeling activity?
    \item \textbf{RQ2.} What is the quality level of the models produced using the graphical and textual approaches?
    \item \textbf{RQ3.} What is the subject's perception regarding the Perceived Ease of Use (PEoU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU) of the proposed DSL?
    \item \textbf{RQ4.} What is the subject's assessment concerning the representation of the ER modeling builders supported in the proposed DSL?
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Hypotheses Formulation:} 
% The first two RQs were taken into account. 
We have taken into account the first two RQs. 
Regarding \textbf{RQ1.} the average effort spent required using each approach, our scientific hypotheses are as follows:
% we defined a two-sided hypotheses that measure the average effort spent between textual and graphical approaches during conceptual modeling. State the null (no difference) $H_0 : \mu Time_T = \mu Time_G$ and alternative (significant difference) $H_a : \mu Time_T \neq Time_G$ hypotheses.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Null hypothesis:} $H_0 : \mu Time_T = \mu Time_G$: There is no difference in the measure of average effort spent between textual and graphical approaches during conceptual modeling.
    \item \textbf{Alternative hypothesis:} $H_{1} : \mu Time_T \neq \mu Time_G$: There is a significant difference in the measure of average effort spent between textual and graphical approaches during conceptual modeling.
\end{itemize}
Regarding \textbf{RQ2.} 
%the modeling effectiveness using each approach, our hypotheses are as follows:
in the same way, we stated two-sided hypotheses that measure the modeling effectiveness between textual and graphical approaches during conceptual modeling.
% The null (no difference) and alternative (significant difference) hypotheses are, respectively: 
% $H_0 : \mu Effectiveness_T = \mu Effectiveness_G$ and 
% $H_a : \mu Effectiveness_T \neq \mu Effectiveness_G$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Null hypothesis:} $H_0 : \mu Effectiveness_T = \mu Effectiveness_G$: There is no difference in effectiveness measures between textual and graphical approaches during conceptual modeling.
    \item \textbf{Alternative hypothesis:} $H_{1} : \mu Effectiveness_T \neq \mu Effectiveness_G$: There is a significant difference in effectiveness measures between textual and graphical approaches during conceptual modeling.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Statistical Methods:} Unlike the first experiment, this replication included a change in the statistical methods adopted.
Previously, we have used the Shapiro-Wilk normality test and the paired T-test for dependent samples.
Hence, this happened because the sample was smaller (27) than 30 elements.
% This was because the sample was smaller (27) than 30 elements.
However, the literature recommends alternative tests for samples equal to or greater than this quantity~\cite{Triola:2018}.
% However, for samples equal to or greater than this quantity, alternative tests are recommended~\cite{Triola:2018}.

For the effort, we chose the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify normality and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for paired samples to investigate the hypotheses using the time spent metric.
For the effectiveness tests, we have adopted the same statistical methods despite instead of using the time spent metric, another measure was necessary.
Thus, we have performed the F1 calculations, deriving from the harmonic mean of precision and recall metrics, for each model produced in both approaches.
% Thus, we have performed the F1 calculations, which is derived from the harmonic mean of \textit{Precision} and \textit{Recall} metrics, for each of the models produced in both approaches.
The F1 calculation~\cite{Derczynski:2016} takes into account variables known as \textit{True Positives}, \textit{False Positives}, and \textit{False Negatives}.
\begin{description}
% \begin{inparadesc}
    \item \textbf{\textit{True Positives (TP)}}: Number of elements correctly modeled using the approach.
    \item \textbf{\textit{False Positives (FP)}}: Number of elements incorrectly modeled using the approach. 
    \item \textbf{\textit{False Negatives (FN)}}: Number of elements not modeled using the approach.
% \end{inparadesc}
\end{description}
From the identification of the variables, it is then possible to calculate the \textit{Precision}, \textit{Recall}, and \textit{F1} of each model according to these formulas:
% From the variables identification it is then possible to calculate the \textit{Precision}, \textit{Recall}, and \textit{F1} of each model according to these formulas:

    \item \textbf{\textit{Precision (PR)}}: $\frac{TP}{TP~+~FP}$ 
    \hfill 
    \textbf{\textit{Recall (RE)}}:$\frac{TP}{TP~+~FN}$
    \hfill
    \textbf{\textit{F1-Score (F1)}}: $\frac{2~*~(PR~*~ RE)}{PR~+~RE}$
\end{description}

\textbf{Experiment Design:} Finally, Figure \ref{fig:designExp} presents the design of the controlled experiment performed. 
We followed the design of one factor with two treatments, where we blocked, balanced, and randomized the subjects, which carried out both treatments, featuring a paired comparison design.

\subsection{Results Analysis}
\label{ssec_experiments:preliminary_resultAnalysis}

We have performed all Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank calculations with the support of the R language and the Gnumeric software. In parallel with the validation of a specialist in the statistics field and the aid of literature~\cite{Triola:2018}.
% All Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank calculations were performed with the support of the R language and the Gnumeric software, in parallel with the validation of a specialist in the field of statistics and the aid of literature~\cite{Triola:2018}.

\textbf{Effort:} 
To answer \textbf{RQ1.},  
%regarding the effort to use the approaches, 
% the execution times were extracted from the instruments.
we have extracted the execution times from the instruments.
From the gross amount of the execution times, we have calculated the difference to perform the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test.
Because it is a statistical test, this technique has the product of measuring the $p$-value.
For this test, we adopted a significance level of $\alpha$~=~5\%.
It means that the p-value is less than 5\%, then we rejected the hypothesis that the distribution is normal.
% This means that the $p$-value is less than 5\% ($p$ < 0.05), a hypothesis that the distribution is normal should be rejected.

After calculations with the set of time differences, we reached a $p$-value of 0.26218.
As $p$-value > $\alpha$, we do not reject the null hypothesis, thus concluding that the data are normally distributed.
%\textit{i.e.}, 
In other words, the difference between the data sample and the normal distribution is not large enough to be statistically significant.
It is important to note that the higher the $p$-value, the more it supports a null hypothesis.
% In the case of the result obtained, the chance of type 1 error (rejecting a null hypothesis that is correct) is very high, and can be translated into 26.21\% (0.26218).
In the case of the result obtained, the chance of type 1 error (rejecting a correct null hypothesis) is very high and translates into 26.21\% (0.26218).
Once we performed the normality tests on the sample, we carried out the hypothesis test of the average effort regarding \textbf{RQ1.}
In the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for dependent samples, we used a significance level of $\alpha$~=~5\%, with which we reached a measure of 0.77948 for the $p$-value.
Because it is a two-tailed test, \textit{i.e.}, it includes equality in its null hypothesis, this $p$-value shows not enough evidence to guarantee the rejection of the statement of $H_0: \mu Time_G = \mu Time_T$.
Therefore, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the approaches have no difference in average efforts since, according to the test, this difference is not statistically significant. 
Figure \ref{fig:boxplotTempo1} displays a box plot with the variation of data observed through these data.

\textbf{Effectiveness:} 
% To answer \textbf{RQ2.} regarding the effectiveness of the use of approaches
To answer \textbf{RQ2.}, regarding the approaches' use effectiveness, we evaluated the artifacts produced by the subjects according to the established reference models\footnote{Available at: \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5454378}}. 
In this evaluation, we used the F1 applied to the pattern recognition and the information retrieval areas.
% In this evaluation, we used F1 from the area of pattern recognition and information retrieval. 
F1 represents the combination of the observed accuracy and the recallability of a result concerning a reference.
By definition, this combination refers to Precision and Recall metrics. On the one hand, Precision is the ratio of the recovered instances by relevance. On the other hand, Recall is the ratio of the relevant instances to the recovered.
% By definition, this combination refers to Precision and Recall metrics, where Precision is the proportion of recovered instances that are relevant and Recall is the proportion of relevant instances that are recovered.

In addition, we performed the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test to F1 for each model. 
After calculations with the set of differences in F1 for each model, we reached a $p$-value of 0.45459.
With this test result, the chance of type 1 error (rejecting a correct null hypothesis) can be very high, and hence we can translate it into 45.45\% (0.45459).
%With this test result, the chance of type 1 error (rejecting a correct null hypothesis) can be very high, and can be translated into 45.45\% (0.45459).

%As the $p$-value > $\alpha$, we do not reject the null hypothesis, thus realizing that the data is normally distributed.
%, \textit{i.e.} the difference between the data sample and the normal distribution is not large enough to be statistically significant.
After we tested the sample for normality, we tested the second hypothesis defined in this experiment.
%After the sample was tested for normality, we tested the second hypothesis defined in this experiment.
This time, in the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test for dependent samples, we used again a significance level of $\alpha$~=~5\%, with which we reached a measure of 0.00197 for the $p$-value.
% By the original statement including an equality, also characterizing this test as two-tailed, it was concluded that the calculated $p$-value demonstrates that there is enough evidence to guarantee the rejection of the statement of the original null hypothesis, denoted as $H_0: \mu Effectiveness_G = \mu Effectiveness_T$.
By the original statement including equality, also characterizing this test as two-tailed, we concluded that the calculated $p$-value demonstrated enough evidence to guarantee the statement rejection of the primary null hypothesis, denoted as $H_0: \mu Effectiveness_G = \mu Effectiveness_T$.
% Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that the approaches have equal effectiveness, because according to the statistical test, the average difference of F1 among treatments is statistically significant.
Therefore, we rejected the null hypothesis that the approaches have equal effectiveness since, according to the statistical test, the average difference of F1 among treatments is statistically significant.
Table \ref{tab:ResultsModelosGeral} shows average measures of the evaluated values and also provides the possibility to carry out a dispersion analysis.
Based on these data, it was possible to verify that the textual approach has an advantage on average.

\textbf{Qualitative Evaluation:} 
We took place with the analysis of the two instruments applied after the modeling tasks.

After summarizing the results, we observed a good acceptance by the subjects for the ERtext tool developed in this work.

\subsection{Threats to Validity}
\label{ssec_experiments:preliminary_threats}
%#######################################################
%#######################################################

In empirical studies, it is necessary to analyze and discuss the threats to validity also the strategies used to mitigate them.
For this list of possible threats, we adopted the classification schema proposed by Cook and Campbell~\cite{Cook:1979}.
%For the list of possible threats, we adopted the classification scheme published by Cook and Campbell~\cite{Cook:1979}. 
These threats followed the proposed pattern, and we divided them into four (4) categories: construct validity, internal validity, external validity, and conclusion validity.
% These threats followed the proposed pattern and were divided into four (4) categories, namely: construct validity, internal validity, external validity and conclusion validity.

\textbf{Construct Validity}: 
Threats to construct validity concerns the experiment design and social factors.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    \item \textit{Inappropriate Pre-operational Explanation}: is related to the fact that the experiment did not have the objective of the artifacts sufficiently defined before translation into measures or treatments. To mitigate this threat, we compared the effort of each approach as well as their effectiveness carried out according to the Precision and Recall metrics; 
    %\item The fact that the experiment did not have the objective of the artifacts sufficiently defined before translation into measures or treatments becomes a threat. To mitigate this threat, we compared the effort of each approach as well as their effectiveness carried out according to the Precision and Recall metrics; 
   
    \item \textit{Interaction of Different Treatments}: 
    if the subjects are involved in one more study, the controls of the different studies can change and reverberate in the final results.
    To avoid this, we followed a paired design and, therefore, all subjects performed both treatments.
    However, we have not observed learning issues during the execution of activities.
    %However, learning issues during the execution of activities were not observed.
    We can verify this through the normality of the analyzed distributions of both samples: effort and effectiveness, demonstrating that the results remained similar as a whole with a low variation; 
    %\textit{i.e.} low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be very close to the mean. 
    
    % \item If the subjects are involved in one more study, the controls of the different studies, can change and reverberate in the final results. 
    % To avoid this, we followed a paired design, and therefore, all subjects performed both treatments. 
    % However, we do not observe learning issues among the execution of activities. 
    % This can be verified through the normality of the analyzed distributions of both samples: effort and effectiveness, demonstrating that the results remained similar as a whole with a low variation.
    
    \item \textit{Hypothesis Prediction}: 
    when subjects participate in an experiment, they may try to find out what the objective or intended experiment result is. 
    This threat can bias the behavior, positively or negatively, depending on the anticipated hypothesis.
    To mitigate this threat, we do not inform the subjects about further details of the experiment; 
    
    \item We do not inform the subjects about further details of the experiment to mitigate the bias of the behavior, which can affect positively or negatively, depending on the anticipated hypothesis.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Internal Validity}: 
Threats to internal validity are the influences that can affect independent variables in correlation to causality without the researcher's knowledge.
\begin{enumerate} [label=\roman*.]
    \item \textit{History}: there is a risk when a specific period influences the experiment's performance. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, we conducted the entire evaluation in a controlled environment providing remote access for the subjects. 
    In addition, to soothe this threat, we carried out the entire process in March when, in general, students are not necessarily overwhelmed with academic activities;
    %\item There is a risk when a specific period influences the experiment's performance. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, we conducted the entire evaluation in a controlled environment providing remote access for the subjects.
    
    \item \textit{Maturation}: occurs concerning the subjects react in different ways over time. 
    Examples are when subjects are affected negatively (tiredness or boredom) or positively (learning) during the experiment execution.
    To alleviate this threat, we informed subjects from the beginning that they could terminate their participation at any time, without any penalty;
    %\item Sometimes the subjects could be affected negatively (tiredness or boredom) or positively (learning) during the experiment execution.
    %To alleviate this threat, we informed subjects from the beginning that they could terminate their participation at any time, without any penalty;
    
    \item \textit{Tests}: 
    if we have repeated the tests, the subjects can respond differently at other times, \textit{i.e.}, they know how to perform the test. 
    If there is a need to become familiar with the tests, we do not return the test results to the participant to not subsidize intentional learning. 
    %If the tests are repeated, the subjects may respond differently at different times, as they know how the test is performed. 
    There was no need for repetition of activities since they were performed once per participant in each treatment;
    %If there is a need to familiarize yourself with the tests, the test results must not be returned to the subject, so as not to support unintentional learning. 
    
    \item \textit{Instrumentation}: 
    is related to the artifacts used to carry out the experiment study, such as data collection forms. 
    %is related to the artifacts used to perform experiment, such as data collection forms. 
    If the design of instruments is poor, then it negatively affects the experience.
    %If these are poorly designed, the experience is negatively affected.
    To combat this threat, we minimally adapted all artifacts due to the design of the experiment (remote) and previously verified and validated in meetings between the researchers involved in this work.
    %To combat this threat, all artifacts were minimally adapted due to the design of the experiment (remote), and previously verified and validated in meetings between the researchers involved in this work.
    In addition, we already had the first study with results counting 27 participants to validate the planned protocol for this experiment replication;
    
    \item We adapted all artifacts due to the design of the experiment (remote), which we verified and validated previously in meetings among the researchers involved in this work to avoid the instrumentation of artifacts that can affect the execution.
    %All artifacts were minimally adapted due to the design of the experiment (remote), and previously verified and validated in meetings between the researchers involved in this work to avoid that the instrumentation of artifacts can be affect the execution.
    In addition, we already had the first study with results counting 27 participants to validate the planned protocol for this experiment replication.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{External Validity}: 
% Threats to external validity are conditions related to experiment replication.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    % \item \textit{Experiment Subjects}: the subjects selected for the experiment may not include a significant group for an study area.
    % Seeking to mitigate this threat, the experiment was carried out with undergrad students of SE and CS programs, and soon, inserted in the context of using the conceptual modeling of relational databases. 
    % In addition, the fact that the sample has more than 30 subjects is also a way of mitigating greater statistical threats in the analyzed area.
    \item We carried out the experimental study with undergrad students of SE and CS programs and soon inserted in the context of using the conceptual database modeling seeking to mitigate the selection of subjects from a significant group for a study area; 
    %In addition, the fact that the sample has more than 30 subjects is also a way of mitigating greater statistical threats in the analyzed area.
    %\item \textit{Subjects Interaction with the Evaluation Artifacts}: is related to the application of the evaluation artifacts of the experiment with the subjects.
    %Depending on the moment, this can affect the experimental results.
    %For example, if a questionnaire is answered a few days after the execution experiment, people tend to respond differently than they would do moments after the activities.
    %To mitigate this threat, participants were asked to answer the questionnaires and, before thanking them, we checked the submission of the instruments.
    \item We asked the participants to answer the questionnaires post-experiment and, before thanking them, we checked the submission of the instruments to avoid the subjects' interaction with the evaluation artifacts can be affected the preliminary experimental results; 
    % \item \textit{Configuration and Treatment Interaction}: is related to the use of an unrepresentative configuration or material. 
    % To soften this threat, documentation was used based on templates and traditional models found in database teaching material. 
    % In addition, the artifacts were validated with two specialists in the field of SE.
    \item We used the documentation based on templates and traditional models found in database teaching material to soften an unrepresentative configuration and material.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Conclusion Validity}: 
% Threats to the validity of the conclusion are related to questions that affect the ability to infer a correct conclusion about the relationship between treatments and the result of an experiment.
\begin{enumerate} [label=\roman*.]
    % \item \textit{Low Statistical Power}:
    % To try mitigating this threat, some statistical methods were adopted, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test as a hypothesis test for dependent samples. 
    % In addition, the tests were reviewed by an expert in the statistics field.
    \item We adopted some statistical methods such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test and the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test as a hypothesis test for dependent samples. We use them to try to mitigate the low statistical power of our preliminary experimental results;
    % \item \textit{Reliability of Measurements}:
    % The reliability of the measurements used has a direct impact on the validity of the experiment as a whole. 
    % To mitigate this threat, it was adopted objective measurements that did not depend on subjective judgment (effort spent, measured in time, and F1).
    % On the other hand, the metrics used for the qualitative evaluation still served as a complementary input in the discussion of the results obtained, alongside with the indication of possible points of improvement in our proposal.
    \item We adopted objective measurements that did not depend on subjective judgment (effort spent, measured in time, and F1) to mitigate the measurement reliability threat.
    On the other hand, the metrics used for the qualitative evaluation still served as a complementary input in the results obtained discussion, alongside the indication of possible points of improvement in our proposal;
    % \textit{Experimental Environment}:
    % The experiment must be carried out in a controlled environment.
    % In order to mitigate this possible threat, we created copies of a virtual machine that were accessed by all subjects. 
    % We also instructed subjects that conversations could not take place during the entire execution of activities, in addition to not leaving the remote environment or access other electronic devices before the end of the tasks.
    \item We created copies of a virtual machine that all subjects accessed to guarantee that we experimented in a controlled environment.

%However, this time the objective was to evaluate, in addition to the language, also the quality of the artifacts produced, the usability and experience of the participants.
Therefore, the intention was to compare the approaches (textual vs graphical) in deeper evaluations of the new features developed in our tool.

We used the same treatments, and the same research questions and hypotheses.
However, it was necessary to adopt different statistical methods due to the size of the samples.

% Os convites foram feitos para uma turma de Engenharia de software e, mediante a oportunidade, foi extendida a outra turma, esta do curso de Ciência da Computação, totalizando cinquenta e quatro (54) respondentes.

%Having said that, in this new execution we obtained a total of twenty-five (25) subjects who agreed to participate, that is, less than half of the respondents.
These subjects performed the tasks remotely in an environment previously prepared by the researchers involved.

% Além de reusarmos os quatro (4) instrumentos de avaliação anteriores, ainda adicionamos um novo instrumento contendo um método não verbal para que os participantes relatassem suas emoções. 
% Este método, chamado de Emocards, tem como base o conceito de Circumplexo de Afeto de Russell~\cite{desmet:2001}.
% Enquanto o Circumplexo de Russel divide as emoções humanas em quadrantes diferentes, o método Emocards o extende adicionando dezesseis (16) representações gráficas de faces humanas.
% Estas representações são pares masculino/feminino, que são então associados a cada um dos octantes contidos nos quadrantes do circumplexo. 
In addition to reusing the four (4) previous assessment instruments, we added a new fifth instrument containing a non-verbal method for participants to report their emotions.
%In addition to reusing the four (4) previous assessment instruments, we also added a new instrument containing a non-verbal method for participants to report their emotions.
This method, called Emocards, is based on the concept of Russell's Circumplex of Affection~\cite{desmet:2001}.
While Russell's Circumplex divides human emotions into different quadrants, the Emocards method extends it by adding sixteen (16) graphical representations of human faces.
These representations are male/female pairs, which are then associated with each of the octants contained in Russell's Circumplex quadrants.
%These representations are male/female pairs, which are then associated with each of the octants contained in the quadrants of the circumplex.

% Os conjunto dos octantes 1 e 2 formam um quadrante que diz respeito as sensações de felicidade.
% O conjunto dos octantes 3 e 4 definem um quadrante relacionado as sensações de relaxamento.
% O conjunto de octantes 5 e 6 formam o quadrante onde a sensações de tristeza estão contidas.
% Finalmentem, os octantes 7 e 8 constituem o quadrante que abrange sensações de irritabilidade.
% A Figura \ref{fig:Octantes} mostra os quatro (4) estados de espírito que são previstos no circumplexo.
The concept of the circumplex and its divisions is that every two (2) octants form a quadrant that defines a state of mind.
The set of octants 1 and 2 forms a quadrant that concerns feelings of happiness.

% Para os geradores da brModelo foi apenas orientado que não era necessário fazer a transformação do modelo conceitual para o lógico ou físico. 
% Isso se deu em razão de tentarmos replicar o experimento anterior visando comparar resultados e, por conta do tempo disponível ser limitado, isso poderia tornar somar mais uma ameaça aos resultados, já que demandaria mais esforço para realizar as tarefas adicionais.

% Levamos em consideração as mesmas hipóteses anteriores, relacionadas ao esforço (tempo) necessário e efetividade (qualidade) alcançada pelos modelos feitos.
% Para a avaliação referente ao esforço foram utilizados o teste de normalidade Shapiro-Wilk, em razão da amostra ter menos de trinta (30) elementos, e o Teste T pareado para amostras dependentes, em que foi levado em consideração os tempos coletados durante a execução das atividades de modelagem do experimento.
We bore in mind the same previous hypotheses related to the effort (time) needed and effectiveness (quality) achieved by the models created.
%We took into account the same previous hypotheses, related to the effort (time) needed and effectiveness (quality) achieved by the models made.
For the evaluation regarding the effort, once the sample had less than thirty (30) elements, we used the Shapiro-Wilk normality test.
Otherside the paired T-Test for dependent samples, when we considered the effort spent collected during the execution of the modeling activities.
%For the evaluation regarding the effort, the Shapiro-Wilk normality test was used, due to the sample having less than thirty (30) elements, and the paired T Test for dependent samples, in which the times collected during the execution of the modeling activities were taken into account.

% O método Shapiro-Wilk testa a hipótese nula de que uma distribuição é normal, mediante o cálculo do valor $W$, onde após é então verificado na tabela do teste\footnote{\url{ http://www.uel.br/projetos/experimental/pages/arquivos/Probabilidades\_Shapiro.pdf }} se ocorre a rejeição ou aceitação da hipótese. 
% O cálculo do método Shapiro-Wilk é dado conforme a fórmula da Equação \ref{eq:Shapiro}: 
The Shapiro-Wilk method tests the null hypothesis by calculating whether is a normal distribution revealed by the value $W$.
Then we can verify in the test table\footnote{\url{ http://www.uel.br/ projects/experimental/pages/arquivos/probabilities\_Shapiro.pdf }} whether the hypothesis is rejected or accepted.
%The Shapiro-Wilk method tests the null hypothesis that a distribution is normal, by calculating the value $W$, after which it is then verified in the test table\footnote{\url{ http://www.uel.br/ projects/experimental/pages/arquivos/probabilities\_Shapiro.pdf }} if the hypothesis is rejected or accepted.
The calculation of the Shapiro-Wilk method is given according to the formula of Equation \ref{eq:Shapiro}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Shapiro}
%\[ 
W = \frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_ix_{(i)}\right)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_i -\overline{x}\right)} 
%\]
\end{equation}

% Uma forma simplificada do Teste T pareado para amostras dependentes
% se dá conforme a fórmula da Equação \ref{eq:TestT}:

is given according to the formula of Equation \ref{eq:TestT}:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:TestT}
%\[ 
t = \frac{m}{s/\sqrt{n}} 
%\]
\end{equation}

% Nesta fórmula o \textit{\textbf{m}} e o \textit{\textbf{s}} são a média e o desvio padrão da diferença (\textbf{\textit{d}}), respectivamente. 
% O \textit{\textbf{n}} corresponde ao tamanho de \textit{\textbf{d}}, ou seja, o tamanho da amostra.
% Este teste de hipótese é usado para comparar as médias de duas amostras relacionadas, ou seja, quando se possui dois valores (ou pares de valores) para uma mesma amostra. 
% Contudo, para comparar as médias dos dois conjuntos de dados emparelhados, as diferenças entre todos os pares precisaram ser calculadas primeiro.
% O nível de significância alfa ($\alpha$) utilizado foi de cinco por cento (5\%).
In this formula, \textit{\textbf{m}} and \textit{\textbf{s}} are the mean and standard deviation of the difference (\textbf{\textit{d}}), respectively.
The \textit{\textbf{n}} corresponds to the size of \textit{\textbf{d}}, that is, the size of the sample.
We used this hypothesis test to compare the means of two related samples, \textit{i.e.}, when you have two values (or pairs of values) for the same sample.
%This hypothesis test is used to compare the means of two related samples, that is, when you have two values (or pairs of values) for the same sample.
However, to compare the means of the two paired data sets, the differences between all pairs had to be calculated first.

% Para os testes da efetividade foram adotados os mesmos métodos estatísticos, porém ao invés do uso da métrica de tempo gasto nas atividades, foi necessário outra grandeza.
% Sendo assim, foram realizados novamente cálculos para uma medida F1, conforme também descrito anteriormente na Seção \ref{ssec_experiments:preliminary_planning}.
We adopted the same statistical methods for the effectiveness tests, but instead of using the effort spent (time) measure on activities, we used another magnitude.
%For the effectiveness tests, the same statistical methods were adopted, but instead of using the metric of time spent on activities, another magnitude was needed.

%Therefore, calculations were performed again for an F1 measure, as also described previously in Section \ref{ssec_experiments:preliminary_planning}.


% A partir dos valores brutos dos tempos foi calculada a diferença para ser possível realizar o teste de normalidade Shapiro-Wilk.
% Por ser um teste estatístico, esta técnica tem como produto a medida do valor-$p$.
% Para este teste foi adotado um nível de significância $\alpha$~=~5\%. 
% Isso significa que se o valor-$p$ for menor que 5\% ($p$ < 0.05), a hipótese nula de que a distribuição é normal deve ser rejeitada.
From the raw time values, the difference was calculated to be able to perform the Shapiro-Wilk normality test.
As it is a statistical test, this technique has as its product the measure of the $p$-value.
A significance level of $\alpha$~=~5\% was adopted for this test.
Hence, through this, if the $p$-value is less than 5\% ($p$ < 0.05), we must reject the null hypothesis since the distribution is not normal.
%This means that if the $p$-value is less than 5\% ($p$ < 0.05), the null hypothesis that the distribution is normal must be rejected.

% Após os cálculos com o conjunto das diferenças dos tempos chegou-se a um valor-$p$ de 0.5991.
% Como valor-$p$ \textgreater $\alpha$, a hipótese nula foi aceita, concluindo assim que os dados são normalmente distribuídos.
% Em outras palavras, a diferença entre a amostra de dados e a distribuição normal não é grande o suficiente para ser estatisticamente significativa.
After the calculations with the set of time differences, we reached a $p$-value of 0.5991.
As $p$-value \textgreater $\alpha$, we accepted the null hypothesis, thus concluding that the data are a normal distribution.
%As $p$-value \textgreater $\alpha$, the null hypothesis was accepted, thus concluding that the data are normally distributed.
In other words, the difference between the sample data and the normal distribution is not large enough to be statistically significant.

% É importante ressaltar que quanto maior o valor-$p$, mais ele suporta uma hipótese nula. 
% No caso do resultado obtido a chance de erro do tipo 1 (rejeitar uma hipótese nula que é correta) é muito alta, podendo ser traduzida em 59,91\% (0.5991).
% Ainda em relação ao teste de normalidade, o valor de \textit{W} calculado foi de 0.968, estando dentro do intervalo aceito do valor crítico de 95\%. 
% Isto significa que existe 95\% de chances da amostra ter origem em uma população normal.
It is important to note that the higher the $p$-value, the more it supports a null hypothesis.
In the case of the result obtained, the chance of a type 1 error (rejecting a correct null hypothesis) is very high, which we can translate into 59.91\% (0.5991).
%In the case of the result obtained, the chance of a type 1 error (rejecting a null hypothesis that is correct) is very high, which can be translated into 59.91\% (0.5991).
Still, about the normality test, we calculated the value of \textit{W} resulting 0.968, being within the range of the critical value accepted of 95\%.
%Still in relation to the normality test, the value of \textit{W} calculated was 0.968, being within the accepted range of the critical value of 95\%.
So this means that there is a 95\% chance that the sample comes from a  population considered normal.
%This means that there is a 95\% chance that the sample comes from a normal population.

% Tendo sido a amostra testada quanto à sua normalidade, foi possível realizar o teste da primeira hipótese estabelecida neste experimento. 
% No teste T pareado para amostras dependentes foi utilizado um nível de significância $\alpha$~=~5\%, com o qual se chegou a uma medida de 0.3492 para o valor-$p$. 
Once we tested the sample for normality, it was possible to test the first hypothesis established in this experiment.
In the paired T-test for dependent samples, we used a significance level of $\alpha$~=~5\%, which reached a measure of 0.3492 for the $p$-value.

% Por ser um teste bicaudal, ou seja, que inclui uma igualdade na sua hipótese nula, esse valor-$p$ não mostra evidências suficientes para garantir a rejeição da afirmativa de $H_0 : \mu Time_G = \mu Time_T$.
% Em resumo, a média dos valores da abordagem gráfica (brModelo) é considerada similar à média da população da abordagem textual (ERtext).
% Em outras palavras, a diferença entre as médias da brModelo e da ERtext não é grande o suficiente para ser estatisticamente significativa.
% A Figura \ref{fig:boxplotTempo2} exibe um gráfico boxplot com a variação observada dos dados obtidos. 
As it is a two-tailed test, that is, it includes an equality in its null hypothesis, this $p$-value does not show enough evidence to guarantee the rejection of the statement of $H_0 : \mu Time_G = \mu Time_T$.
In short, we considered the average of the values of the graphical approach (brModelo) similar to the textual one (ERtext).

% Para avaliar a hipotése referente a efetividade do uso das abordagens, os artefatos produzidos pelos sujeitos foram avaliados conforme os modelos de referência previamente estabelecidos.
% Como dito, nesta avaliação foi utilizada a medida F1, uma medida proveniente da área de reconhecimento de padrões e recuperação de informação. 
% Essa medida representa a combinação da precisão e revocabilidade observada de um resultado em relação à uma referência.
To assess the hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of using the approaches, we analyzed the artifacts produced by the subjects according to the previously established reference models.
As mentioned, we used in this evaluation the F1 measure, this measure from the area of pattern recognition and information retrieval.
This measure represents the combination of the accuracy observed and the recallability of a result against a reference.

% Após a obtenção dos valores F1 de cada modelo, foi realizado o teste de normalidade Shapiro-Wilk.
% Após os cálculos com o conjunto das diferenças da medida F1 de cada modelo, chegou-se a um valor-$p$ de 0.5166.
% Com este resultado obtido a chance de erro do tipo 1 (rejeitar uma hipótese nula que é correta) pode ser muito alta, podendo ser traduzida em 51,66\% (0.5166).
After obtaining the F1 values of each model, we performed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test.
After the calculations with the set of differences of the F1 measure of each model, we reached a $p$-value of 0.5166.
With this result obtained, the chance of a type 1 error (rejecting a correct null hypothesis) can be very high, which we can translate into 51.66\% (0.5166).

% Como o valor-$p$ \textgreater $\alpha$, a hipótese nula foi aceita, constatando assim que os dados são normalmente distribuídos, isto é, a diferença entre a amostra de dados e uma distribuição normal não é grande o suficiente para ser estatisticamente significativa.
As the value-$p$ \textgreater $\alpha$, we accepted the null hypothesis, thus noting that the data are a normal distribution, \textit{i.e.}, the difference between the sample of data and normal distribution is not large enough to be statistically significant.
%As the value-$p$ \textgreater $\alpha$, the null hypothesis was accepted, thus noting that the data are normally distributed, that is, the difference between the sample of data and a normal distribution is not large enough to be statistically significant.

% Após a amostra ser testada quanto à sua normalidade, foi realizado o teste da segunda hipótese definida, relativa a efetividade (qualidade) das abordagens. 
% Desta vez, no teste T pareado para amostra dependentes, novamente foi utilizado um nível de significância $\alpha$~=~5\%, com o qual se chegou a uma medida de 0.2147 para o valor-$p$. 
After we tested the sample for normality, we performed the test of the second hypothesis defined concerning the effectiveness (quality) of the approaches.
%After the sample was tested for normality, the test of the second defined hypothesis was performed, concerning the effectiveness (quality) of the approaches.

%This time, in the paired T-test for dependent samples, a significance level $\alpha$~=~5\% was used again, with which a measure of 0.2147 was reached for the $p$-value.

% Pela afirmativa original incluir uma igualdade, caracterizando também este teste como bicaudal, chegou-se a conclusão que o valor-$p$ calculado demonstra que não há evidências suficientes para garantir a rejeição da afirmativa da hipótese nula original, denotada como $H_0 : \mu Effectiveness_G = \mu Effectiveness_T$.
% Logo, a hipótese nula de que as abordagens possuem efetividades iguais é aceita, pois segundo o teste a diferença média da medida F1 entre os tratamentos não é estatisticamente significativa.
% A Figura \ref{tab:ResultsModelosGeral2} apresenta as medidas médias dos valores avaliados, e também fornecem a possibilidade para a realização de uma análise de dispersão.
By the original statement including equality, also characterizing this test as two-tailed, we concluded that the calculated $p$-value demonstrates that there is not enough evidence to guarantee the rejection of the statement of the original null hypothesis, denoted as $H_0 : \mu Effectiveness_G = \mu Effectiveness_T$.

Therefore, we accepted the null hypothesis that the approaches have equal effectiveness because, in accord with the test, the mean difference of the F1 measure between the treatments is not statistically significant.
%Therefore, the null hypothesis that the approaches have equal effectiveness is accepted, because according to the test, the mean difference of the F1 measure between the treatments is not statistically significant.

% Por exemplo, o Sujeito 03 demonstrou que se sentia com um sentimento de irritabilidade enquanto utilizava a ferramenta brModelo, enquanto estava em um aspecto de emoção ligada a felicidade no uso da ferramenta ERtext.
% Isso se traduziu na avaliação do \ac{sus}, uma vez que o sujeito avaliou de melhor forma a abordagem textual frente a abordagem gráfica.
For example, subject S03 demonstrated that he felt a feeling of irritability while using the brModelo tool, while he was in an aspect of emotion linked to happiness in the use of the ERtext tool.

\section{Chapter Lessons}
\label{sec_experiments:lessons}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

% Este capítulo apresentou uma replicação preliminar de um experimento controlado, chamado \ac{ex1}, com uma amostra de 33 sujeitos avaliando a proposta ERtext, uma proposta de ferramenta textual utilizando uma \ac{dsl} para modelagem conceitual do \acp{db}.
% Comparamos a ERtext com a brModelo, uma ferramenta de abordagem gráfica bastante conhecida nas aulas de Computação.
This chapter presented a preliminary replication of a controlled experiment, called \ac{ex1}, with a sample of 33 subjects evaluating the ERtext proposal, a proposed textual tool using \ac{dsl} for conceptual modeling of \acp{db} .
We compared ERtext with brModelo, a graphical approach tool well known in Computing classes.

% Em seguida, foram realizados mais outros dois experimentos.
% O \ac{ex2} foi uma nova replicação com algumas modificações no protocolo, especificamente a adição de instrumentos novos, e tendo desta vez vinte e cinco (25) participantes.
% O objetivo foi realizar uma nova análise do esforço e eficácia das abordagens com cada ferramenta. 
% Ainda buscou-se fazer uma avaliação mais profunda da qualidade no uso utilizando conceitos como o de circumplexo de Russel combinado com o método Emocards.
Then, two more experiments were carried out.
\ac{ex2} was a new replication with some modifications in the protocol, specifically the addition of new instruments, and this time having twenty-five (25) participants.
The objective was to carry out a new analysis of the effort and effectiveness of the approaches with each tool.
We also sought to make a deeper assessment of the quality of use by applying concepts of Russell's circumplex combined with the Emocards method.

% Finalmente, o \ac{ex3} foi outra nova execução do protocolo, agora com a adição do formulário \ac{sus} e de uma análise qualitativa por codificação.
% Este último experimento contou com quinze (15) participantes e objetivou avaliar os diversos artefatos (modelos conceituais, diagramas, modelos lógicos e instruções \ac{sql}) que podiam ser gerados por ambas as ferramentas.
Finally, \ac{ex3} was another new implementation of the protocol, now with the addition of the \ac{sus} form and a qualitative coding analysis.
This last experiment had fifteen (15) participants and aimed to evaluate the various artifacts (conceptual models, diagrams, logical models and \ac{sql} instructions) that could be generated by both tools.

% Desta forma chegou-se a um conjunto de três (3) avaliações empíricas com um total combinado de setenta e três (73) participantes. 
% Com os resultados obtidos, foi possível responder aos quatro QRs do experimento, bem como às duas hipóteses associadas.
% Nesse sentido, podemos dizer que investigamos três aspectos principais do nosso \ac{dsl}: esforço, eficácia e qualidade no uso.
In this way, a set of three (3) empirical evaluations was reached with a combined total of seventy-three (73) participants.
With the results obtained, it was possible to answer the four RQs of the experiment, as well as the two associated hypotheses.
In this sense, we can say that we investigated three main aspects of our \ac{dsl}: effort, effectiveness and quality in use.

% A partir da análise de todos os conjuntos de dados obtidos, é possível destacar os seguintes aspectos:
From the analysis of all datasets obtained, it is possible to highlight the following aspects:

% \item \textbf{Esforço:} A diferença média calculada nos experimentos constata que não há diferenças entre as abordagens, \textit{ie}, uma abordagem não é mais rápida que a outra.
\item \textbf{Effort:} The average difference calculated in the experiments concludes that there are no differences between the approaches, \textit{i.e.}, one approach is not faster than the other.

% \item \textbf{Eficácia:} Através do teste estatístico rejeitamos a hipótese nula de que as abordagens são igualmente eficazes no \ac{ex1}.
% Ao comparar os gráficos box-plot produzidos, é possível observar uma pequena vantagem para a abordagem textual de cerca de 5\% em média.
% Contudo, no \ac{ex2} observou-se que não houve diferenças estatisticamente significativas quanto aos artefatos modelados.
% Na realidade, o qualidade média teve uma diferença de cerca de pouco mais de 1\% no \ac{ex2}.
% Isso demonstra que de certa forma é possível se sustentar que ambas as abordagens são similares quanto a qualidade dos modelos produzidos, haja visto a baixa diferença percentual apreciada.
% Também não descartamos possíveis influências causadas pelo fato de os experimentos terem sido conduzidos remotamente por conta do contexto de pandemia.
\item \textbf{Efficacy:} Through the statistical test we reject the null hypothesis that the approaches are equally effective in \ac{ex1}.
When comparing the box-plot plots produced, it is possible to observe a small advantage for the textual approach of about 5\% on average.
However, in \ac{ex2} it was observed that there were no statistically significant differences regarding the modeled artifacts.
In fact, the average quality had a difference of about a little over 1\% on \ac{ex2}.
This demonstrates that in a way it is possible to sustain that both approaches are similar in terms of the quality of the models produced, given the low percentage difference appreciated.
We also don’t discard possible influences caused by the fact that the experiments were conducted remotely due to the pandemic context.

% \item \textbf{Comparação qualitativa entre tratamentos:} Observou-se certo equilíbrio entre os tratamentos, mas com avaliação positiva para ERtext quanto aos atributos ``Produtividade'' e ``Operabilidade'' no \ac{ex1}.
% A principal vantagem observada quanto a brModelo se deu no \ac{ex2} em relação ao atributo de ``aprendizibilidade''.
\item \textbf{Qualitative comparison between treatments:} There was a certain balance between treatments, but with a positive evaluation for ERtext regarding the attributes ``Productivity'' and ``Operability'' in \ac{ex1}.
The main advantage observed for brModelo occurred in \ac{ex2} in relation to the ``Learnability'' attribute.

% \item Também coletamos \textbf{feedback qualitativo}, inclusive na forma de \textbf{respostas abertas} de indivíduos que participaram dos experimentos:
% Como resultado, existem algumas melhorias em relação ao design da \ac{dsl} que precisam ser revisadas, em particular nos relacionamentos ternários (\ac{ex1} e \ac{ex2}) e autorrelações (\ac{ex1}).
% Quanto a codificação de respostas abertas recebidas no \ac{ex3}, conseguimos mapear algumas críticas e sugestões interessantes para o planejamento de uma evolução da ERtext, sobretudo quanto a criação dinâmica e personalização de diagramas equivalentes as descrições textuais.
\item We also collected \textbf{qualitative feedback}, including in the form of \textbf{open-ended responses} from subjects who participated in the experiments:
As a result, there are some improvements regarding the design of \ac{dsl} that need to be revised, in particular in the ternary relationships (\ac{ex1} and \ac{ex2}) and self-relationships (\ac{ex1}).
Concerning the coding of the responses of open-ended questions received in \ac{ex3}, we were able to map some interesting criticisms and suggestions for planning an evolution of ERtext, especially regarding the dynamic creation and customization of diagrams equivalent to textual descriptions.

% Uma vez que está prevista a continuidade do desenvolvimento do \ac{dsl}, a execução de uma possível refatoração, e também a implementação de novos construtores de ER, é um passo natural para a evolução do solução.
% A partir dos resultados experimentais obtidos, concluímos que há viabilidade e boas perspectivas para nossa solução proposta como uma alternativa de ferramenta de apoio ao processo de ensino-aprendizagem.
Since the development of \ac{dsl} is expected to continue, the execution of a possible refactoring, as well as the implementation of new \ac{er} builders, is a natural step towards the evolution of the solution.
From the experimental results obtained, we conclude that there is feasibility and good prospects for our proposed solution as an alternative tool to support the teaching-learning process.

% \textbf{TESTE DE HIPÓTESE}\\
% Método: \textbf{Teste T pareado (amostras dependentes, com menos de 30 elementos)}\\~\\
% \textbf{MEDIDA-F}\\
% P-value	= 0.2147 com $\alpha$~=~5\% (Significance level)\\ 
% Sample size (n)	25\\
% Como o valor de P \textgreater $\alpha$, \textbf{H0 não pode ser rejeitada}.
% A média dos valores da brModelo é considerada igual à média da população da ERtext.
% Em outras palavras, a \textbf{diferença} entre as médias d brModelo e da ERtext \textbf{não é grande o suficiente para ser estatisticamente significativa}.\\
% \textbf{Lembrete: Um resultado de não significância não pode provar que H0 está correta, apenas que a suposição nula não pode ser rejeitada, ou seja, não se aceita H0 mas sim deixa-se de rejeitar H0.}
